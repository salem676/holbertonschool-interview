0x0B-menger

This interview practice algorithm utilizes the concept of a Menger Sponge (also known as Menger Cube, Menger Universal Cube, Sierpinski Cube, or Sierpinski Sponge). The Menger Sponge starts as a cube (level 0), then with each subsequent layer, the face of the cube is divided into 9 squares (3 x 3), sub-diving the cube into 27 mini-cubes. The smaller cube is removed from the middle of each face, leaving a hole, and the very center of the large cube is removed, leaving 20 mini-cubes. This process of dividing into and removing mini-cubes is repeated for more levels. While a typical Menger Sponge is 3-dimensional, this algorithm builds a 2D Menger sponge. The idea is the same, but the dividing and removing is applied only to one face of the original cube, so each level divides the square into 9 mini-squares and the center square is always removed.

2D Menger Sponge

    Write a C function void menger(int level) that draws a 2D Menger Sponge:
        level is the level of Menger Sponge to draw
        if level is less than 0, the function does nothing
        if level is 0, the sponge is represented by the # character
        for level == N sponges, where N is greater than 0, the sponge is a 3x3 square of level N - 1 sponges, except the center one which is left empty
